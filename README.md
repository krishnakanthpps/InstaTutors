 ## Overview
InstaTutors is a platform created by students to help middle and high school students schedule online tutoring sessions with qualified student tutors. All tutoring sessions are held over video chat, and the service is offered for FREE.

Our mission is to provide better tutoring solutions to students from any background, anywhere.
 
 ## Inspiration
In 2018, InstaTutors was founded on the belief that students around the world, from any background, deserve a quality, top-tier tutoring experience. We aim to spread knowledge and practical help to students who need it. 
 
 ## How it works: 
 1) Create an account, and verify your email (or login with a Google Account). You will be prompted to enter some basic information about yourself.
 2) Once you're logged in, you can make a tutoring request. Browse all our available courses/subjects, and use the "view tutors" feature to match with the perfect tutor.
 3) You will receive an email when a tutor accepts your request, and your tutor will personally email you shortly after with a link to a private video chat room on appear.in. Simply join when it comes time for your FREE tutoring session!

## Ask a Question
Ask a question in a subject you need help with with our question feature and you will receive a response from a qualified tutor in less than 2 hours! You can check out the answer in the "my questions" section, or your email inbox.

 ## Before shutting down in March of 2019...
We had over 24 Tutors, 137 Students, and conducted a total of 75 Sessions.
